# Welcome to the PlayStation Vita/PlayStation TV Packet Capture Archive!

![2021-08-02-085545](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67494727/127869135-2891abbd-0ff8-47fb-9b6c-1213cc9e8e1f.png)

As the fabled [PlayStation Vita](https://blog.playstation.com/archive/2011/10/19/playstation-vita-launches-from-22-february-2012/) is now **10 years old** (as I'm currently writing this in 2021), and many of its [services/features](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/important-notice/) are now defunct/inoperable. As an avid [preservationist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BppPWh49ROU) and a fanboy to the PlayStation Vita, I decided to start to analyze multiple Vita titles & network servers in hopes for a server emulation solution in the future. The main purpose of this archive is to **preserve/document** the history of the Vita as this console is obscure in many aspects. This archive will contain various packet captures for many PlayStation Vita titles that support online multiplayer capabilities. 

Moreover, this is a little *side-project* for me as I am currently working on another preservation project called [Destination Home](https://github.com/DestinationHome) which is currently restoring [PlayStation Home's online client](https://youtu.be/D7LQP5SDUjU). 

**Disclaimer:** This repo is only for educational/preservational purposes.
